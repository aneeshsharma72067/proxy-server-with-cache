This is a multi-threaded proxy server with LRU cache written in C. I created this projec to learn about networks, semaphores, threads, structures, sockets etc.

This project was created with the help of a brilliant youtuber Lovepreet Singh, please checkout his channel if you want to level up your software development skill. And no, he is not just a MERN stack or web dev youtuber, he teaches actual software development.
