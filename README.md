# Proxy Server with LRU cache

This is a multi-threaded proxy server with LRU cache written in C. I created this project to learn about OS and Networking concepts such as semaphores, threads, sockets, proxy, etc.

In this project, I am using a library `proxy_parse.c` written by Matvey Arye to parse my requests. This project is for UNIX based OS. I am a windows user so I used Ubuntu in WSL.

This project was created with the help of a brilliant youtuber Lovepreet Singh, please checkout his channel if you want to level up your software development skill. And no, he is not just a MERN stack or web dev youtuber, he teaches actual software development.
